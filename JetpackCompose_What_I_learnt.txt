Hi I'm Batuhan. 
I am starting to interest  Android Kotlin Development. 
After old-fashioned XML and layout coding,I started with Jetpack Compose Techniques.
In this project I copied the Gmail mobile user interface with static data's.
I learnt to use Cards and learnt open drawable menu's.
Column,Row objects and modifiers for designs are more familiar for me now.
I can add scroll specification to functions.
I learnt Scaffold states,floatingbutton and openDialog to.
Jetpack Compose is nice and interesting for me.
I am going to learn more of these.
Also I kept the codes in order.
